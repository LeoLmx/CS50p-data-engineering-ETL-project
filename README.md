# CS50p-data-engineering-ETL-project

This is the final assignment for the CS50p programming in Python. You have to make a code that has three functions and a main function along with the testing code.

[Here is the link](https://youtu.be/eM5YP4JeWCU) for the video presentation, so you understand the concept better.

I made an ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) pipeline, commonly used in Data Engineering to extract the data from two json files that has a list of banks by market cap, transform them by multiplying it to a csv file that has the rates of all currencies referenced in USD, loading it into a simple csv file.

*Be aware that this code is just a representation of the code that was done on a local machine, some sections of the code must be changed in order to work properly in a virtual environment like Kaggle.*
